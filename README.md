First of all, you need to install NodeJS on your computer, then run two commands, one for the back end, the other for the front end:

Frontend: npm i @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-brands-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-regular-svg-icons @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome @material-ui/core @material-ui/icons @stripe/react-stripe-js @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react @testing-library/user-event axios react-bootstrap react react-dom react-redux react-responsive react-router react-router-dom react-scripts redux redux-thunk styled-components react-icons bootstrap style-component npm install jquery popper.js react-chartjs-2 chart.js

Backend: npm i bcryptjs body-parser dotenv express express-async-handler express-mysql-session express-session init jsonwebtoken moment mysql multer 

npm i --save-dev eslint morgan mysql2 nodemon sequelize sequelize-cli

All FE and BE servers use this command: npm start.

When you run back-end code, there is no data in my system. You must create the database and run dataInsert.js after you add all data from the data-js-file which is saved under the dictionary type.

If you have any problem when your FE doesn't work, just make sure that you have react-router V6.
